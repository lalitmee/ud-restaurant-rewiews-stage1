## Description

- This Project was created as part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Scholarship Nanodegree. This is an application which works on the basis of **service workers** concept. Service workers helps our website to run without any internet connection. And other things you will know when you will run the website first time with internet connection so that service worker can do it's work

## Run the Application

In order to run the application follow these steps:

- Download as .zip file or clone this project:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lalitmee/ud-restaurant-rewiews-stage1.git
```

- `cd ud-restaurant-rewiews-stage1`

- You need to open two terminals. First one for application server and second one for the data for the application

- You need to run the data server on the port **3000**. Sorry for making it static.

- In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

- In a terminal, check the version of Python you have:
  `python -V`.
  If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with
  `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
  (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use
  `python3 -m http.server 8000`.
  If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

- With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
